# star_wars_project

My first python project.  
Using Star Wars databases from Kaggle, I created a 'Star Wars Vehicle Comparison Tool'.  
For each vehicle class, it compares in a table features such as 'cost in credits', 'speed', 'passengers capacity', etc.  
By selecting any 2 vehicles, the comparison is done visually in a chart.  

As a bonus, added a height comparison by species chart.
